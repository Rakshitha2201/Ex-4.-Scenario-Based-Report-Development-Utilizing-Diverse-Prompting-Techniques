# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
## Aim: 

Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Algorithm: 
**Phase 1: Design & Foundation**
Define the Persona (Persona-Based Prompting): Start by creating a detailed persona for the chatbot. The prompt should explicitly define its name, role, tone (e.g., professional, empathetic), and communication style.

Set the Rules (Instruction-Based Prompting): Provide clear, high-level instructions that establish the chatbot's core tasks and behavioral constraints, such as its primary functions and fallback behavior.

**Phase 2: Implementation & Training**
Build Foundational Knowledge (Zero-Shot & Few-Shot Prompting):

Zero-Shot: Test the chatbot's baseline knowledge on simple, common inquiries without providing examples.

Few-Shot: For more complex or structured tasks, provide a small number of high-quality examples to guide the chatbot on the desired output format and content.

Develop Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought Prompting): To handle multi-step problems, craft prompts that force the chatbot to reason step-by-step. This improves the accuracy and transparency of its logical conclusions.

Expand and Scale (Meta-Prompting): Create meta-prompts to automatically generate new training data and prompts. This is a crucial step for rapidly expanding the chatbot's knowledge base and adapting it to new products or policies.

**Phase 3: Evaluation & Refinement**
Test for Accuracy (Scenario-Based Prompting): Create full, multi-turn scenarios to simulate real-world conversations. This tests the chatbot's ability to handle complex interactions and maintain context.

Refine Responses (Reflection & Self-Correction Prompting): Implement a feedback loop where the chatbot is prompted to review its own answers. The algorithm should instruct the chatbot to identify and correct any errors before the final response is delivered.

Enhance User Experience (Analogy Prompting): For technical or complex topics, include an instruction to use a simple analogy. This step-by-step process ensures the chatbot's responses are not only accurate but also easy for a layperson to understand.
## Prompt:
Give a scenario-based report on designing and implementing an AI powered chatbot for customer support and enquires. Apply more prompting techniques like( Personabased, Instruction-based, and Scenario-based)
## Output:
### 1. The RetailCo Scenario: A Customer Support Challenge
RetailCo operates a popular e-commerce platform specializing in home goods. They receive thousands of customer inquiries daily related to order status, returns, product information, and technical issues. The current human-driven support system is overwhelmed, leading to long wait times and customer dissatisfaction. The goal is to deploy "Retail-Bot" to handle up to 80% of routine inquiries, freeing up human agents for more complex issues.

### 2. Applying Prompting Techniques for Chatbot Development
**2.1 Persona-Based Prompting: Defining "Retail-Bot"**
This technique establishes the chatbot's personality and communication style. A well-defined persona ensures a consistent and positive user experience.

Prompt:

"You are 'Retail-Bot,' a friendly, empathetic, and professional customer service assistant for RetailCo. Your goal is to provide helpful, concise, and accurate support. Always use a polite and reassuring tone. End each conversation by asking, 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today?'"

Expected Output: All future responses from the chatbot will adhere to this persona, making it feel more human-like and trustworthy.

**2.2 Instruction-Based Prompting: Core Functionality**
This is the most direct prompting technique, used for fundamental commands. It sets the ground rules for how the chatbot should operate.

Prompt:

"Your primary task is to answer customer questions related to order status, returns, and product information. If you do not have the information, state that you cannot help and offer to transfer the customer to a live agent."

Expected Output: The chatbot will follow these explicit instructions, providing a clear boundary for its capabilities and a designated fallback for unhandled queries.

**2.3 Zero-Shot Prompting: Handling Basic Queries**
This technique allows the chatbot to respond to a query without any prior examples. It relies on the model's vast pre-existing knowledge.

Prompt:

"What are RetailCo's store hours?"

Expected Output: The chatbot, having been trained on billions of parameters, can likely provide a standard response like, "RetailCo is an online-only store and is open 24/7."

**2.4 Few-Shot Prompting: Learning from Examples**
This technique provides a few examples within the prompt to guide the AI towards a specific desired output format or behavior. It is excellent for fine-tuning responses for specific situations.

Prompt:

"Here are a few examples of how to handle a late order inquiry:

Customer: 'My order is late.'
Chatbot: 'Hello! I apologize for the delay. Can you please provide your order number so I can check the status?'

Now, handle the following:
Customer: 'My package hasn't arrived.' "

Expected Output: The chatbot will use the provided example as a template and respond with a similar structure, such as, "Hello! I can help with that. What is your order number?"


**2.5 Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Logical Reasoning for Complex Tasks**
This technique forces the AI to reason step-by-step, making its thought process explicit. It is crucial for handling multi-step problems like returns.

Prompt:

"Here is a request from a customer: 'I want to return a blender I bought 35 days ago.'

Think step-by-step:

What is the customer's goal?

What is RetailCo's return policy (30 days from purchase)?

Does the customer's request fall within the policy?

If not, what is the most empathetic way to inform the customer and offer a possible alternative solution?"

Expected Output: The chatbot will break down the problem logically and respond with a clear and empathetic denial, such as, "I'm sorry, our return policy is 30 days. Unfortunately, your purchase is outside that window. However, I can offer you a 15% discount on your next purchase as a courtesy."

**2.6 Role-Based Prompting: Functionality for Specific Tasks**
This technique assigns a specific, functional role to the chatbot. While similar to persona-based, this is about what the bot does, not who it is.

Prompt:

"Act as a product expert for RetailCo. Your job is to answer all technical questions about our coffee makers and blenders. Do not discuss order status or returns."

Expected Output: When asked about a product, the chatbot will provide detailed, accurate information (e.g., "The 'BrewMaster 500' has a 12-cup capacity and a thermal carafe"). When asked about an order, it will politely decline and redirect the query.

**2.7 Scenario-Based Prompting: Simulating Complex Interactions**
This technique provides the AI with a complete context or story. It trains the chatbot to understand and act within a full, multi-turn conversation.

Prompt:

"Customer A is upset because their order is late and they paid for expedited shipping. They are using an angry tone. Act as 'Retail-Bot' and handle this interaction by first apologizing, then explaining the delay, and finally offering a refund on the shipping fee. Your goal is to de-escalate the situation."

Expected Output: The chatbot will handle the entire simulated conversation with a focus on de-escalation, leading to a resolved and positive outcome for the customer.

**2.8 Reflection Prompting**
Purpose: This technique forces the AI to critically evaluate its own response before providing it. It is excellent for reducing factual errors and ensuring the answer is the best possible one. This is especially useful for complex or ambiguous queries.

Scenario: A customer is asking a complex question about product compatibility that requires a multi-step logical check.

Prompt:

"Customer: 'Does the "Smart Hub 2.0" work with the "Eco-Sense" temperature sensor?'

Before you answer, reflect on the following:

Retrieve the compatibility list for the "Smart Hub 2.0."

Check if "Eco-Sense" is on the list.

If not, what is the closest compatible product?

Explain your answer to the customer clearly, referencing the compatibility issue and offering a solution."

Simulated Output:

Retail-Bot: "That's a great question! I've double-checked our compatibility list for the Smart Hub 2.0. The Eco-Sense temperature sensor is not directly compatible. However, the 'Clima-Trak' sensor is fully compatible and offers similar features. Would you like me to provide more details on the Clima-Trak?"

**2.9 Self-Correction Prompting**
Purpose: This is an evolution of reflection prompting. It not only encourages the AI to evaluate its answer but also provides an explicit instruction to fix any detected errors. This is crucial for maintaining accuracy.

Scenario: The chatbot initially provides an incorrect detail about a product. The self-correction prompt catches this before the final response is delivered.

Prompt:

"Customer: 'How much does the new "Ultra-Light" vacuum cleaner weigh?'

Instructions:

Provide the weight of the vacuum cleaner.

Now, review your answer. Is the weight correct according to the product specifications (5.5 lbs)?

If your answer is incorrect, provide the correct weight and a polite correction."

Simulated Output:

Internal Thought Process: "Initial answer: 'The vacuum weighs 6.2 lbs.' Self-Correction Check: The correct weight is 5.5 lbs. My initial answer was incorrect. I must correct it."

Retail-Bot: "That's a good question! The new Ultra-Light vacuum cleaner weighs just 5.5 lbs. This makes it easy to maneuver and lift."


**2.10 Meta-Prompting**
Purpose: This is a high-level technique where the prompt is about generating other prompts. It's used to automate the content generation process and ensure all responses follow a specific format and tone, as defined in a master prompt.

Scenario: The goal is to generate 20 more product information prompts, all following the same structure.

Prompt:

"You are a prompt generator. Your task is to create 20 new prompts for 'Retail-Bot.' Each prompt should ask for a product's main features and a benefit for the customer. The prompt must be in this format: 'What are the key features of the [Product Name]? Explain the main benefit of [Feature].' The products should be from a home appliance category, like kitchen gadgets or small electronics."

**3.Implementation and Results**
By applying this diverse set of prompting techniques, the "Retail-Bot" chatbot can be developed in a structured and effective manner.

Phase 1 (Design): The persona and instruction-based prompts establish a clear foundation.

Phase 2 (Development): Zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompts train the chatbot on specific behaviors and logical reasoning.

Phase 3 (Testing): Scenario-based prompts are used to evaluate the chatbot's performance in real-world situations, providing a comprehensive test of its capabilities.

The expected results of this approach are:

Increased Accuracy: The use of Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought prompting significantly reduces the number of incorrect responses.

Improved User Experience: Persona-based prompting ensures the chatbot is friendly and helpful, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

Higher Resolution Rate: A combination of all techniques allows the chatbot to handle a wider variety of inquiries, reducing the need for human agent transfers.
